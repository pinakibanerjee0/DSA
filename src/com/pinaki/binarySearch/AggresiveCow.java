	 * Problem Statement: There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. The stalls
	 * are located on a straight line at positions x1,….,xN (0 <= xi <=
	 * 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the
	 * minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the
	 * largest minimum distance?
	 * 
	 * Examples:
	 * 
	 * Input: No of stalls = 5 Array: {1,2,8,4,9} And number of cows: 3
	 * 
	 * Output: One integer, the largest minimum distance 3
	 * when Cow1 is in 1st place , Cow2 is in 4th and Cow3 in 8th or 9th
	 * largest minDistance between Cow1 and Cow2 is 3
